/* volatile unsigned char* pointers are there because

 * 2. When the variable itself is not volatile the compiler is
 *    not required to keep all those reads and can convert
 *    this into canonical memcmp() which doesn't read the whole block.
 * Pointers to volatile resolve the first problem fully. The second
 * problem cannot be resolved in any Standard-compliant way but this
 * works the problem around. Compilers typically react to
 * pointers to volatile by preserving the reads and writes through them.
 * The latter is not required by the Standard if the memory pointed to
 * is not volatile.
 * Pointers themselves are volatile in the function signature to work
 * around a subtle bug in gcc 4.6+ which causes writes through
