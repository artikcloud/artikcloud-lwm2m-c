=head1 DESCRIPTION

Since the introduction of the ENGINE API, the recommended way of controlling
default implementations is by using the ENGINE API functions. The default
B<RAND_METHOD>, as set by RAND_set_rand_method() and returned by
RAND_get_rand_method(), is only used if no ENGINE has been set as the default
"rand" implementation. Hence, these two functions are no longer the recommended
way to control defaults.

If an alternative B<RAND_METHOD> implementation is being used (either set
directly or as provided by an ENGINE module), then it is entirely responsible
for the generation and management of a cryptographically secure PRNG stream. The
mechanisms described below relate solely to the software PRNG implementation
built in to OpenSSL and used by default.

These functions implement a cryptographically secure pseudo-random
number generator (PRNG). It is used by other library functions for
example to generate random keys, and applications can use it when they
need randomness.

A cryptographic PRNG must be seeded with unpredictable data such as
mouse movements or keys pressed at random by the user. This is
described in L<RAND_add(3)>. Its state can be saved in a seed file
(see L<RAND_load_file(3)>) to avoid having to go through the
seeding process whenever the application is started.

L<RAND_bytes(3)> describes how to obtain random data from the
PRNG.
