=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library implements type-checked dynamic hash tables. The hash
table entries can be arbitrary structures. Usually they consist of key
and value fields.

lh_<type>_new() creates a new B<LHASH_OF(<type>> structure to store
arbitrary data entries, and provides the 'hash' and 'compare'
callbacks to be used in organising the table's entries.  The B<hash>
callback takes a pointer to a table entry as its argument and returns
an unsigned long hash value for its key field.  The hash value is
normally truncated to a power of 2, so make sure that your hash
function returns well mixed low order bits.  The B<compare> callback
takes two arguments (pointers to two hash table entries), and returns
0 if their keys are equal, non-zero otherwise.  If your hash table
will contain items of some particular type and the B<hash> and
B<compare> callbacks hash/compare these types, then the
B<DECLARE_LHASH_HASH_FN> and B<IMPLEMENT_LHASH_COMP_FN> macros can be
used to create callback wrappers of the prototypes required by
lh_<type>_new().  These provide per-variable casts before calling the
type-specific callbacks written by the application author.  These
macros, as well as those used for the "doall" callbacks, are defined
as;

 #define DECLARE_LHASH_HASH_FN(name, o_type) \
	 unsigned long name##_LHASH_HASH(const void *);
 #define IMPLEMENT_LHASH_HASH_FN(name, o_type) \
	 unsigned long name##_LHASH_HASH(const void *arg) { \
		 const o_type *a = arg; \
		 return name##_hash(a); }
 #define LHASH_HASH_FN(name) name##_LHASH_HASH

 #define DECLARE_LHASH_COMP_FN(name, o_type) \
	 int name##_LHASH_COMP(const void *, const void *);
 #define IMPLEMENT_LHASH_COMP_FN(name, o_type) \
	 int name##_LHASH_COMP(const void *arg1, const void *arg2) { \
		 const o_type *a = arg1;		    \
		 const o_type *b = arg2; \
		 return name##_cmp(a,b); }
 #define LHASH_COMP_FN(name) name##_LHASH_COMP

 #define DECLARE_LHASH_DOALL_FN(name, o_type) \
	 void name##_LHASH_DOALL(void *);
 #define IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_FN(name, o_type) \
	 void name##_LHASH_DOALL(void *arg) { \
		 o_type *a = arg; \
		 name##_doall(a); }
 #define LHASH_DOALL_FN(name) name##_LHASH_DOALL

 #define DECLARE_LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(name, o_type, a_type) \
	 void name##_LHASH_DOALL_ARG(void *, void *);
 #define IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(name, o_type, a_type) \
	 void name##_LHASH_DOALL_ARG(void *arg1, void *arg2) { \
		 o_type *a = arg1; \
		 a_type *b = arg2; \
		 name##_doall_arg(a, b); }
 #define LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(name) name##_LHASH_DOALL_ARG

 An example of a hash table storing (pointers to) structures of type 'STUFF'
 could be defined as follows;

 /* Calculates the hash value of 'tohash' (implemented elsewhere) */
 unsigned long STUFF_hash(const STUFF *tohash);
 /* Orders 'arg1' and 'arg2' (implemented elsewhere) */
 int stuff_cmp(const STUFF *arg1, const STUFF *arg2);
 /* Create the type-safe wrapper functions for use in the LHASH internals */
 static IMPLEMENT_LHASH_HASH_FN(stuff, STUFF);
 static IMPLEMENT_LHASH_COMP_FN(stuff, STUFF);
 /* ... */
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
         /* Create the new hash table using the hash/compare wrappers */
         LHASH_OF(STUFF) *hashtable = lh_STUFF_new(LHASH_HASH_FN(STUFF_hash),
                                   LHASH_COMP_FN(STUFF_cmp));
	 /* ... */
 }

lh_<type>_free() frees the B<LHASH_OF(<type>> structure
B<table>. Allocated hash table entries will not be freed; consider
using lh_<type>_doall() to deallocate any remaining entries in the
hash table (see below).

lh_<type>_insert() inserts the structure pointed to by B<data> into
B<table>.  If there already is an entry with the same key, the old
value is replaced. Note that lh_<type>_insert() stores pointers, the
data are not copied.

lh_<type>_delete() deletes an entry from B<table>.

lh_<type>_retrieve() looks up an entry in B<table>. Normally, B<data>
is a structure with the key field(s) set; the function will return a
pointer to a fully populated structure.

lh_<type>_doall() will, for every entry in the hash table, call
B<func> with the data item as its parameter.  For lh_<type>_doall()
and lh_<type>_doall_arg(), function pointer casting should be avoided
in the callbacks (see B<NOTE>) - instead use the declare/implement
macros to create type-checked wrappers that cast variables prior to
calling your type-specific callbacks.  An example of this is
illustrated here where the callback is used to cleanup resources for
items in the hash table prior to the hashtable itself being
deallocated:

 /* Cleans up resources belonging to 'a' (this is implemented elsewhere) */
 void STUFF_cleanup_doall(STUFF *a);
 /* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for "STUFF_cleanup" */
 IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_FN(STUFF_cleanup, STUFF)
         /* ... then later in the code ... */
 /* So to run "STUFF_cleanup" against all items in a hash table ... */
 lh_STUFF_doall(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_FN(STUFF_cleanup));
 /* Then the hash table itself can be deallocated */
 lh_STUFF_free(hashtable);

When doing this, be careful if you delete entries from the hash table
in your callbacks: the table may decrease in size, moving the item
that you are currently on down lower in the hash table - this could
cause some entries to be skipped during the iteration.  The second
best solution to this problem is to set hash-E<gt>down_load=0 before
you start (which will stop the hash table ever decreasing in size).
The best solution is probably to avoid deleting items from the hash
table inside a "doall" callback!

lh_<type>_doall_arg() is the same as lh_<type>_doall() except that
B<func> will be called with B<arg> as the second argument and B<func>
should be of type B<LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN_TYPE> (a callback prototype
that is passed both the table entry and an extra argument).  As with
lh_doall(), you can instead choose to declare your callback with a
prototype matching the types you are dealing with and use the
declare/implement macros to create compatible wrappers that cast
variables before calling your type-specific callbacks.  An example of
this is demonstrated here (printing all hash table entries to a BIO
that is provided by the caller):

 /* Prints item 'a' to 'output_bio' (this is implemented elsewhere) */
 void STUFF_print_doall_arg(const STUFF *a, BIO *output_bio);
 /* Implement a prototype-compatible wrapper for "STUFF_print" */
 static IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(STUFF, const STUFF, BIO)
         /* ... then later in the code ... */
 /* Print out the entire hashtable to a particular BIO */
 lh_STUFF_doall_arg(hashtable, LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN(STUFF_print), BIO,
                    logging_bio);
 
lh_<type>_error() can be used to determine if an error occurred in the last
operation. lh_<type>_error() is a macro.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

lh_<type>_new() returns B<NULL> on error, otherwise a pointer to the new
B<LHASH> structure.

When a hash table entry is replaced, lh_<type>_insert() returns the value
being replaced. B<NULL> is returned on normal operation and on error.

lh_<type>_delete() returns the entry being deleted.  B<NULL> is returned if
there is no such value in the hash table.

lh_<type>_retrieve() returns the hash table entry if it has been found,
B<NULL> otherwise.

lh_<type>_error() returns 1 if an error occurred in the last operation, 0
otherwise.

lh_<type>_free(), lh_<type>_doall() and lh_<type>_doall_arg() return no values.

=head1 NOTE

The various LHASH macros and callback types exist to make it possible
to write type-checked code without resorting to function-prototype
casting - an evil that makes application code much harder to
audit/verify and also opens the window of opportunity for stack
corruption and other hard-to-find bugs.  It also, apparently, violates
ANSI-C.

The LHASH code regards table entries as constant data.  As such, it
internally represents lh_insert()'d items with a "const void *"
pointer type.  This is why callbacks such as those used by lh_doall()
and lh_doall_arg() declare their prototypes with "const", even for the
parameters that pass back the table items' data pointers - for
consistency, user-provided data is "const" at all times as far as the
LHASH code is concerned.  However, as callers are themselves providing
these pointers, they can choose whether they too should be treating
all such parameters as constant.

As an example, a hash table may be maintained by code that, for
reasons of encapsulation, has only "const" access to the data being
indexed in the hash table (ie. it is returned as "const" from
elsewhere in their code) - in this case the LHASH prototypes are
appropriate as-is.  Conversely, if the caller is responsible for the
life-time of the data in question, then they may well wish to make
modifications to table item passed back in the lh_doall() or
lh_doall_arg() callbacks (see the "STUFF_cleanup" example above).  If
so, the caller can either cast the "const" away (if they're providing
the raw callbacks themselves) or use the macros to declare/implement
the wrapper functions without "const" types.

Callers that only have "const" access to data they're indexing in a
table, yet declare callbacks without constant types (or cast the
"const" away themselves), are therefore creating their own risks/bugs
without being encouraged to do so by the API.  On a related note,
those auditing code should pay special attention to any instances of
DECLARE/IMPLEMENT_LHASH_DOALL_[ARG_]_FN macros that provide types
without any "const" qualifiers.
